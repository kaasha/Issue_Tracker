#File Description
issue_tracker_terminal.py=>Takes console input of url from user and displays output in table form
issue_tracker.py=>Takes input from textbox(however has dependency on tkinter,so it is just from UI purpose)


#Given more time

1.Checks can be include to confirm whether its a valid repo or not(however I have 
included status_code check)
2.Total number of pages can be found and differnt threads can be spawned to 
operate on each page and further combine the results
3.Application can log the output in a file and can be run as a cronjob per 
day(every 24 hrs),with the results being mailed to requested email aliases
4.A better UI can be made with buttons and text boxes to display result
5.Would have added unit tests.

#URL where application is live
