# issue_tracker

Track issues according to date


#Solution

1.Do a get on issues of input repo
2.Find diffrence between cur_time and created_at time of each open issue
(by creating datetime object)
3.Incrementing the counter for all open issues
4.Displaying the output in table form using prettyTable,stating total number of open 
issues,issues opened in last 24hrs,issue opened before 24 hrs and less than 7 
days ago,issues opened more than 7 days ago



#Given more time

1.Checks can be include to confirm whether its a valid repo or not(however I have 
included status_code check)
2.Total number of pages can be found and differnt threads can be spawned to 
operate on each page and further combine the results
3.Application can log the output in a file and can be run as a cronjob per 
day(every 24 hrs),with the results being mailed to requested email aliases
4.A better UI can be made with buttons and text boxes to display result
5.Would have added unit tests.
